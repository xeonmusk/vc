3 Step Frame Work:
    1.define 2.evaluate 3. build
Value prop Statement:
    for:who(target customer)
    dissatisfied with: what they want for satisafction.
    due to:the problem of customer
    offers a:the solution that you offer
    that provides:the key benfits of your solution.

Define:

        -who are hindus
        -restaurants
    evryone?
    a segment?
    what is that segment?
    minimum valuble segment

User vs Customer:
Ask the customer about the product.
    What:
        problem well stated is half solved.

$4U's:problems worth solving usally
    unworkable:StartUp secret--->if the consequences are costly or painful,so much the better.who get's fired if it doesnt work.
                if doesnt do no jobs and employemnt.
                B2B and B2C
                what is at the root.-->ask the user 90% and get their view point.
     
    unavoidable:is the problem so fundamenta you can not avoid it and jsut have to comply?
                two examples we all face?

                government 
    urgent:if you are not at the top ofthe list,are you at least in te top theree?if not,will you get moved up overtime.why?

                relative to other needs: we will compete with others.

    undeserved: you will compete in a zero sum game.
                you are competing for finite resources:
                -time
                -money
                -people
                -attention
Define the market need:is it BLACK & WHITE
                            -Blatent:
                            -latent:
                            -Aspirational:late need look good
                            -Critical:important ipad
                      :does the market need to have a DEBT?
                       -what dependencies are involved?
                       -What external factors involved?
                       -would you face any black slash?
                       -what is the timimg?

StartUp Oppertunity?
    -Faster: 
    -Cheper: 10%
    -Better:

Define the solution.
    -Disruptive? :business or techonolgy (change the game) breakthrough. pick low prices and fast deliveryies AMAZON...
    -Discontinuous? :somenthing you could not do before this?(cloud computing-ilab)
    -Defensible? :moats
                defensibility from the outset
                property ip,govt licence,favorable location,favorable long term contract,minimum efficient scale facility,access ton data(google,facebook,blooberg) 
    (*=Differnt enough-evaluate next section)
                defensibilty with scale:

My proj:
    Disruptive: no one doing business here and selling products to others.
    Discontinuous: my idea to sell the product from stores
    Defensible: contarct with gov and amke fuure better.
      insted of(better,chepaer,faster)

Evaluate:
Value Matrix:
    Value = Benefits - Cost
    Monetary benefits:
        -revenue increase
        -cost reduction
        -time savings
    Non-monetary benefits:
        -risk reduction 
        -convenience
        -status/image
    Hard costs:
        -purchase price
        -maintenance
        -training
    Soft costs:
        -risk
        -effort
        -political capital

Qualitative evolution:
    product status:
    Before              |       after
                vitamin vs pencilin
    actual pain         |       absolute joy

                                jobs for people

Gain of Adoption:
-convenience
-speed of trasfer
-ease of use                GAIN----------BALENCED-----------PAIN
-Fun to use
-Network useEffect
etc

-yet another app
-most securit bank
-security risk
-not everyone has it
-Trust issue-Sending money to wrong people.

ask user? not all things
    why wolud you not buying my product.    GAIN----------------Inertiarisk--------PAIN

Inertia to adoption:

or split bil with two debit cards?
risk using a startup for money transfer?

what is right ratio?
    30 % 90.
    gain  pain ration needed to good
    gain >10 and pain will be below 10

****Added security measures
****easy signup
****QR code scan to i.d.users+4 digit conformation
****Network effect everyone on it.

Customer view and gain pain Ratio:
    GAIN:
        -Revenue
        -Cost savings
        -time
        -people
